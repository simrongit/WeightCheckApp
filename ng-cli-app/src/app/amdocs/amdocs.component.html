      Idea behind this tool was to give concise information which can help us in understanding fallout trend

      Human error is big threat to data when update runs on production data. This tool is created to prevent it. 
      Not good enough, consider it as POC. It works for simple query only.
      I used it for generating tracking information with old and new value. Which we have to do.
      <ul>
        <li>It checks for count. Count will confirm your intention how many rows you are expecting to update.</li>
        <li>Support basic validations</li>
        <li>Help in creating tracking entry. Tracking changes is must for production data. 
          This tool create query which extracts new and old value to store in tracking table</li>

      <p class="mb-1">Hi,
          
          Currently Sonar report generation tool doesn’t create report in below shown format.
          We need this format in order to distribute efforts of fixing errors. Generally we provide a developer set of classes which contain specified Critical/Major errors.
          
          Priority
          Package
          Class
          Error
          LineNumber

          MAJOR

          EndUserCustomerPropertiesDecorator,
          Unused private method
          57
          pmd
          
          Beside report generation it also performing filtering part.
          It will consider only those classes which has package starting from “amdocs.oms.cust”
          It will filter out APM auto generated classes. By looking for pattern in class name that is all characters are capital.
          
          Its usage
          C:\del>java -jar XMLParser.jar
          Result.xls is created
          
          Pre-requisite
          Need 4 files at location where jar is being run from.
          pmd-result.xml, checkstyle-result.xml, findbugs-result.xml – These can be found in .sonar folder of Sonar Runner.
          NOTE: In order to generate checkstyle-result.xml you need to add “sonar.checkstyle.generateXml = true” at end of the file of “sonar-project.properties” which is located in bin folder of Sonar Runner
          rules.csv – This is generated from sonar. Below is screen shot for same.

      <p class="mb-1">I have created a tool which works on the HF report generated from AMC. You need to run “run.bat” in order to execute it.
          It includes yesterday report for which you can generate analysis.
          
          NOTE: It might not cover all the scenario. So suggestion is to take information from the analysis and send it to application team for confirmation. Something in a format like “HF2 exist which is same as HF1 so we should reject HF1, please confirm”. As of now Logic works on Deployed/UnDeployed/Rejected status. May be in future we can use other status in the analysis.
          
          Steps for getting report from AMC.
          Login into AMC
          Click on “Transactions Report”
          Select OMS as application.
          Select date range.
          Save the report
          Open this report
          Remove first two rows.
          While saving it will prompt you to save in another format. Select xls of 97-2003.
          Update the name of report on run.bat
          Click on run.bat
          Analysis excel will be opened.
          Put filter and take HF Id highlighted in grey.
          
          Also it can used for other applications

          Every user can see all GDD Only files.
          GDD Only files will be retrieved for last 3 months. 
          Now we can also see empty tasks in the list.
          
          Please do send new feature requirement which can help everyone.
          
          NOTE: Extract the zip file then run the batch file for generating excel file. Property files resides in properties folder.
          
          I am also thinking of having this application as web app. Where everyone can see the results and set the custom filter. If required will click on refresh button to get latest data.
          Major challenge is having excel like filter on data. Your suggestions are welcome.

          I have created basic program for performance tool.
          It give below output after processing OrderingPerformanceLog. Attached is same.
          Need to enhance it for below requirements.

          Add stack count to get idea which timing is included in other timing.

          Performance Analyser
          Working. Attached is presentation for same with example.
          In OMS performance logging we print time taken by various methods/APIs/Queries/Services. This tool reads total time taken by a activity and start subtracting time from it those time which are considered as atomic e.g. API calls and DB calls. Whatever the time is left based on it reports whether there is issue or not.
          NOTE: we heavily rely on this logging as analyzing from profiling tool (JProfiler) adds its own computation time while performing calculations. Hence performance logging is much more accurate.

          http://simrond09:8181/ProcedureSite/AMX/UnixServerStatus.jsp this tool give you same.
          It will be most useful to us when testing team start using it and doesn’t open defect which is caused by env being down.
          Let me know your suggestions for same.

      <p class="mb-1">I have created a program which take the output of the sql and sends it over the email.
          It is helpful in cases where output we want to show comes directly in select query.
          It supports multiple select query also.
          
          Its usage require two steps
          Create text file as shown below
          Schedule it in crontab

          #Query is required to be written in single line
          #There should not be semi colon at end of query
          #You can define any number of query. Enusre you when you add query then don't put 0 as preffix. For e.g. Query05 should be written as Query5

          It works on simple principal, it scans connector log for step with assumption that start and end tag, as provided in request name will encapsulate it completely and email the last set of it.
          
          There are two modes.
          Order Mode : You can provide order action id and it will figure out everything. ☺
          Step Mode : You can select request or enter manually if doesn’t exist.

      </div>
      <p class="mb-1">
        
        You need to create MnP in a format so that tool can use it.

          Format standard used is JSON. So you can read in depth about square braces, double quote, commas etc.
          Anything which you see on left side of colon(:) is static. No change allowed
          It starts with what input you need to user. Like I used order_action_id, you can give any name.
          Its recommended to write MnP in lower case in order to avoid accidental string match between query and replaced input parameter
          Then you write select query to validate input.
          Same is bound with user friendly message which you want to show to user.
          NOTE : from select query only 1 row is expected. Select items can only be String.
          Area defines in which DB query is supposed to execute.
        Let me know if you have any question.

          Encrypted file mechanism implementation.
          
        Proposed enhancements
          Use connection pool, it will result in better user experience as it will feel fast.
          Make it smart. 
            50 %, Take only OA id as input thus minimizing input from user.
            70%, Based on form id and error of order action it will decide what all MnPs can be applied.
            95%, It will decide MnP and run it. If none found then it will report.
          Extract connection management to file. Will bring flexibility of addition of when MnP require interaction with other application.
          Auto tracking information creation. It will reduce effort of MnP developer as it he/she won’t have to write tracking sql. Also result in better consistent tracking information.
          Addition of resend tool. For immediate movement of order.
          Addition of cancelation tool. For support of cancelation via OMS API.
          Detail page creation, it will be used for case when no MnP is applicable so that people can find anomalies faster.
            OMS information.
            OMS and CM reconciled information.
            Error check information.
          Tool limitation removal
            Only 1 row will be picked from select query
            Only String input is required from select query
